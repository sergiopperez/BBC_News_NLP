# Classification model for the BBC news archive


In this repository I provide a script to analyze the BBC news archive. The main tasks that the script performs are:

- Tokenize the BBC news and labels
- Construct a model based on an embedding layer and two dense layers
- Train the model and evaluate performance
- Visualize the weights of the embedding layer: the code generates two files that can be uploaded to http://projector.tensorflow.org/
